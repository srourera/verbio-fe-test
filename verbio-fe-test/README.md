### Some comments
Taking into account that this was my first VueJS project, the project structure could be different to the optimal structure for VueJS projects.

Comming from Angular, I've adapted the project to fit a little the structure of Angular projects I'm used to.

I would need some more time to get used to VueJS and read some good practices and good structures for it.

### Other concerns

Please note that the `/welcomeMessage` API (specified in the PDF you sent me), it's actually `/getWelcomeMessage`.
